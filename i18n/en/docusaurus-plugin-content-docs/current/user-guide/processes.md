# Process Management

## Overview

Process management in Arkflows allows you to design, implement, and monitor business processes using the BPMN 2.0 standard. This guide will help you understand how to create and manage processes effectively.

## Creating a New Process

### 1. Access the Process Designer
1. Navigate to the "Processes" section in the main menu
2. Click "Create New Process"
3. Enter a name and description for your process

### 2. Basic Elements
- **Start Event**: Marks the beginning of a process
- **End Event**: Marks the completion of a process
- **Tasks**: Represent work to be performed
- **Gateways**: Control the flow of the process
- **Sequence Flows**: Connect elements in the process

### 3. Adding Elements
1. Drag elements from the palette to the canvas
2. Connect elements using sequence flows
3. Configure element properties in the properties panel

## Process Configuration

### 1. Task Types
- **User Tasks**: Require human interaction
- **Service Tasks**: Automated system tasks
- **Script Tasks**: Execute custom scripts
- **Business Rule Tasks**: Apply business rules

### 2. Form Integration
- Attach forms to user tasks
- Configure form fields and validation
- Set up dynamic form behavior

### 3. Process Variables
- Define process variables
- Set default values
- Configure variable scope

## Process Execution

### 1. Starting a Process
1. Select the process from the list
2. Click "Start Process"
3. Fill in required variables
4. Submit to begin execution

### 2. Task Management
- View assigned tasks
- Complete task actions
- Track task status
- Handle task reassignment

### 3. Process Monitoring
- View process instances
- Track execution progress
- Monitor performance metrics
- Analyze bottlenecks

## Best Practices

### 1. Process Design
- Keep processes simple and clear
- Use meaningful names for elements
- Document process logic
- Test processes thoroughly

### 2. Performance
- Optimize process flow
- Minimize unnecessary steps
- Use appropriate task types
- Implement error handling

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular process review
- Update documentation
- Monitor performance
- Address issues promptly

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues
- Process not starting
- Tasks not appearing
- Form submission errors
- Integration failures

### 2. Solutions
- Check process configuration
- Verify user permissions
- Review form settings
- Test integrations

### 3. Support
- Contact support team
- Check documentation
- Review error logs
- Use debugging tools

## Advanced Features

### 1. Subprocesses
- Create reusable process components
- Implement complex logic
- Improve process organization
- Enhance maintainability

### 2. Error Handling
- Configure error events
- Set up compensation
- Implement retry logic
- Define error boundaries

### 3. Process Versioning
- Manage process versions
- Track changes
- Roll back if needed
- Maintain history

## Integration

### 1. System Integration
- Connect with external systems
- Configure API endpoints
- Set up data mapping
- Handle responses

### 2. Event Handling
- Configure event listeners
- Process external events
- Trigger process actions
- Handle notifications

### 3. Data Management
- Define data structures
- Configure data flow
- Implement data validation
- Ensure data integrity
